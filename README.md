GDP and Life Expectancy Analysis

Project Overview

This project analyzes the relationship between Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and life expectancy across six countries from 2000 to 2015. Using data from the World Health Organization and the World Bank, the project explores how economic growth correlates with health outcomes in these countries.

Dataset

The dataset includes:
Countries: Chile, China, Germany, Mexico, United States, and Zimbabwe
Variables:
GDP (in USD)
Life expectancy at birth (in years)
Year (2000â€“2015)
The data was sourced from the World Health Organization and the World Bank.

Objective

The objective of this project is to explore and visualize the relationship between GDP and life expectancy. It includes data preprocessing, statistical exploration, and visualization to answer questions about the correlation between economic performance and life expectancy.

Visualizations

The project includes the following visualizations:
Scatter plot of GDP vs. life expectancy by country
Line plots for GDP and life expectancy trends over time
Bar plot for GDP comparison across countries
Box plot for life expectancy distribution by country

Conclusion

This analysis highlights the complex relationship between economic performance and public health, revealing that while GDP and life expectancy are positively correlated, other factors also influence health outcomes. This project can be expanded by analyzing more countries and considering additional socioeconomic variables."# GDP_LifeExpectancy_Analysis"
